# VideoFeedPage Relay Rebuild Log

## Target

- Relay file: `2054381889128513537`
- Target page id: `7:3`
- Source document: `jd-design-system-md-v16/product-architecture/comprehensive-business/content-ecosystem/video/video-feed/design.md`
- Created frame: `8:134` — `VideoFeedPage / complete / immersive / 375x812`

## Generated JSON

- `jd-design-system-md-v16/product-architecture/comprehensive-business/content-ecosystem/video/video-feed/relay-page-rebuild.json`

This JSON is the page-level normalized rebuild contract used before drawing the Relay frame.

## Created Page Nodes

- `8:134` — full page frame, `375×812`
- `8:135` — `Video Content / base layer / TODO_ASSET real video frame`
- `8:140` — `video-top-tab / immersive / default`, `363×44`
- `8:163` — `interactive-area / without_grass / default`, `50×319`
- `8:193` — `info-layer / card+tag+chapter / bottom-left`, `274×190`
- `8:213` — `bottom-tab / Type A / comment entry / keyboard-aware base`, `375×82`

## Component Coverage

- `video-top-tab`: immersive/default layout, menu + TabList + search, selected `视频`.
- `interactive-area`: default rail, avatar + like + comment + share + muted volume.
- `info-layer`: tag row + nickname/copy + product card + chapter strip.
- `bottom-tab`: Type A comment entry with placeholder `善语评论，文明发言`.
- `SystemSafeArea`: represented by bottom Home Indicator placeholder.

## Assets

Created as SVG/vector nodes:

- top menu/search icons
- InteractiveArea add/like/comment/share/volume icons
- bottom comment and happy icons

Still placeholder-only:

- real video frame
- author avatar image
- product image
- info-layer tag icon
- chapter waveform icon

## MCP Approximation Notes

- This is a full page composition rebuilt from `design.md`, not a pixel clone of Relay `2075:224`.
- Video content is represented by an abstract dark video placeholder because no real video frame asset is available.
- Page-level z-index, keyboard avoidance, BottomSheet motion, and true safe-area runtime values are documented as TODO in `design.md`; the Relay frame uses static positions for this first complete page.
- Some SVGs were created as simplified vector equivalents to keep the page editable in Relay.

## Verification

- Screenshot checked after creation.
- Metadata checked for the full frame and major child frames.
- A follow-up normalization pass constrained top icon visual size to `22×22` inside `44×44` hit areas and kept key text bounds within their component containers.

## 2026-05-27 Repair Pass

User review found three issues in Relay node `8:134`: the interaction rail used a simplified icon pass, the page composition used `interactive-area / without_grass / default`, and the Type A bottom bar was incorrectly rendered as a rounded input pill.

Applied repairs:

- Rebuilt the interaction rail as `8:2371` — `interactive-area / with_grass / default`, following the page-level component contract: avatar, like, comment, grass, share, muted volume.
- Replaced local interaction icons from `jd-design-system-md-v16/product-architecture/comprehensive-business/content-ecosystem/video/video-feed/assets/icons`: `icon-add.svg`, `icon-like-default.svg`, `icon-comment-default.svg`, `icon-grass-default.svg`, `icon-share-default.svg`, and `icon-volume-mute-fill.svg`.
- Repositioned `8:2371` to `x=313, y=250` to keep the 12dp right margin and align the taller `with_grass` rail lower in the video page.
- Recreated the interaction labels and centered them visually inside the 50dp action width: `8:2421`, `8:2422`, `8:2423`, `8:2424`.
- Repaired `8:213` — `bottom-tab / Type A / comment entry / transparent inline / keyboard-aware base`.
- Replaced the bottom comment entry with a transparent inline row using `icon-comment-check-brand.svg`, `icon-happy.svg`, 12pt placeholder text, and the page-owned dark bottom background.
- Repaired `8:193` — `info-layer / text-only / html-current / no-tag-no-card / locked-bounds`, matching `jd-design-system-md-v16/product-architecture/comprehensive-business/content-ecosystem/video/video-feed/index.html` current `.info-layer` state.
- Removed the incorrectly emitted tag row, product card, and chapter strip from the current page state.
- Locked info-layer coordinates to the HTML CSS values: `x=11`, `y=672`, `width=274`, `height=46`, nickname line `20`, body row `y=28`, body row `18`.

Still intentionally placeholder-only:

- video frame bitmap
- author avatar image
- product image only for a later info-layer product-card variant
- info-layer tag icon only for a later tag variant
- chapter waveform icon only for a later chapter variant

## Next Steps

1. Replace TODO video / avatar / product assets with real images.
2. Create additional state pages for `commenting`, `keyboard-visible`, and BottomSheet-open.
3. Add explicit info-layer variant pages only when the corresponding HTML/feed state includes tag, product card, or chapter data.
4. Add Type B bottom strip page state using current video payload.
5. Compare against source Relay node `2075:224` if pixel-level parity is required.
